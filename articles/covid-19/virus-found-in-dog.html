        The Hongkong Government announced on Friday at 00:55 Hongkong time a
        case of animal infection of the novel coronavirus.
      </p>
      <p>
        It involves a domestic dog of a patient who was infected earlier, said a
        spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
        The test result for the virus found in the body of the dog was however
        "weak positive".
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this incident, the officials added that those domestic pets
        should also be put under quarantine if their owners are infected with
        COVID-19.
